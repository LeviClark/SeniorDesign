# Here is the basic Git workflow for a refresher.
# Basic git commands:
# git pull origin master - updates it off master, overriding your changes
# git pull --rebase origin master - updates while keeping your local changes
# git checkout -b new-branch-name - creates a new branch where you should do all of your current work from
# git checkout existing-branch-name - switches to an existing branch
# git status - shows your files youve changed
# git diff . - shows the actual changes in the code
# git add . -adds all changes to be committed
# git commit -m  "short commit message explaining what youre committing " - commits the changes
# git push origin your-branch-name -pushes up your code so you can create a Pull Request from github
